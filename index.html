                <h2>My name is Ralph Davis and I am a current atendee at All Star Code. I am 15 years old, I go to The Brooklyn Latin School, and I am an aspiring Chief Information Security Officer. I have skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and this is my first year of experience in the 10th grade which I am very proud of. I am great with academics and I have an active life in my school. I love to play football in my pass time and just hang out with friends like most teens my age. </h2>

                <h2>I live in New York and I enjoy coding and sports a lot. I've always looked at movies of those hackers going into secretbases, picking electronic locks, disabling laser beams to diamonds and such and thats why I gained an interest the code. But now that I am officially in the field I have found out that it is so much more than that; coding to me is like learning a human language and I am determine to stay dedicated to gain more experience and understanding with it. Since a young age I was always introduced to various sports especially football playing with cousins at the park and such, so I magically fell in love with it.</h2>

                <h2>I live in a Jamaican household and I have to say I do not regret anything about it! I am proud of my heritage and am constantly trying to find more about myself and my ancestors every single day. Growing up I was always taught about peace and prosperity between family and how love is a universal concept that develops in deep roots. I've been through a lot of things my mother has always wanted me to succeed and life and who could blame her because that's what all parents strive for their children to be; without her I wouldn't be where I am today so I will forever be thankful for her presence in my life. In the distant future I would love to further pursue a career in coding because as I have said before it is a great passion of mine, however I would also love to volunteer for programs that help not just my community but issues that take place all around the world!</h2>
